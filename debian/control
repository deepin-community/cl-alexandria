Description: collection of portable Common Lisp utilities
 Alexandria is a collection of utilities in the public domain for Common Lisp.
 .
 It is a library but also a project that aims to reduce duplication of effort
 and improve portability of Common Lisp code according to its own idiosyncratic
 and rather conservative aesthetic.
 .
 It is used by other projects as a base to build on.
